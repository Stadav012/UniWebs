# UniWebs

UniWebs is an interactive hub for real-time campus life, connecting students to events, clubs, and trending topics across campus. Students can view a live map of events, find crowd-sourced "hot spots" for socializing or studying, and use personalized dashboards to stay updated on activities that match their interests. With features like anonymous shoutouts for spontaneous meetups and dedicated profiles for campus organizations, UniWebs encourages social connections and engagement. This project will focus on real-time event updates, personalized feeds, and a dynamic user interface that makes discovering campus life effortless and fun.
